Q1 consists of karatsuba.java and q1.java .

karatsuba.java is the recursive task object we use in q1.java to run q1.

Use main in q1.java to run q1. 

p.s. Commented out a second run of forkjoin pool where I can run n = 1 and n = 6 at the same time.


Q2 consists of q2.c, instructions to compile are above main in comments.
added a commented out helper function to print input string to a txt file instead of screen as it get pretty long.

My computer has 6 cores.
